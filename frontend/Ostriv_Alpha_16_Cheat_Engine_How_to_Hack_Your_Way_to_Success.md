A cheat engine is a software tool that allows you to scan and edit the memory of a running game. You can use it to change values such as money, resources, population, health, and more. However, using a cheat engine can also cause some problems such as crashes, glitches, or corrupted saves. Therefore, you should always backup your game files before using a cheat engine and use it at your own risk.
 
Here are the steps to use a cheat engine for Ostriv Alpha 1.6:
 
1. Download and install Cheat Engine from [https://www.cheatengine.org/](https://www.cheatengine.org/).
2. Run Ostriv and load your save game or start a new one.
3. Run Cheat Engine and click on the computer icon in the upper left corner.
4. Select Ostriv.exe from the process list and click Open.
5. In the Value Type drop-down menu, select 4 Bytes.
6. In the Value box, enter the amount of money you have in the game and click First Scan.
7. You should see one or more addresses in the left panel. If there are too many, go back to the game and spend or earn some money, then enter the new amount in the Value box and click Next Scan.
8. When you have only one address left, double-click on it to add it to the bottom panel.
9. Double-click on the value in the bottom panel and change it to any amount you want.
10. Go back to the game and enjoy your unlimited money.

You can use the same method to change other values such as resources, population, health, etc. Just make sure you select the correct value type (e.g. Float for health) and scan for the exact value (e.g. 100 for full health).
 
Alternatively, you can also download a trainer for Ostriv Alpha 1.6 from [https://mrantifun.net/threads/ostriv-trainer.15450/](https://mrantifun.net/threads/ostriv-trainer.15450/). A trainer is a program that runs alongside the game and provides you with hotkeys to activate various cheats. The trainer for Ostriv Alpha 1.6 has three options: unlimited resources, unlimited money, and set game speed. To use it, follow these steps:

1. Download and run Ostriv (Steam) v0.5.0.5 Trainer +3 from [https://mrantifun.net/threads/ostriv-trainer.15450/](https://mrantifun.net/threads/ostriv-trainer.15450/).

Note that some antivirus programs may detect cheat engines or trainers as malware or viruses. This is usually a false positive caused by their ability to modify memory or inject code into other processes. You may need to disable your antivirus or add an exception for them before using them.
